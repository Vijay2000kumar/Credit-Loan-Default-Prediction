# Credit-Loan-Default-Prediction
Machine Learning Project using dataset
Credit Card Loan Prediction is a machine learning model that uses historical data to predict whether a credit card holder will default on their loan payments. This model is designed to assist financial institutions in identifying high-risk borrowers and minimizing the risk of loan defaults.

The Credit Card Loan Prediction model uses a variety of algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest, to analyze the dataset and predict the likelihood of loan default. The dataset includes various features such as credit card usage patterns, payment history, credit score, age, gender, and other demographic information that could be relevant to the prediction.

Based on the analysis, the model generates a credit risk score, which can be used by financial institutions to determine the level of credit risk associated with a borrower. This score can be used to approve or reject loan applications, set interest rates, or even determine the credit limit for the borrower.

The Credit Card Loan Prediction model can help financial institutions to minimize the risk of loan defaults and make informed decisions about lending. It can also help borrowers to improve their credit score and reduce the likelihood of loan defaults.

Overall, the Credit Card Loan Prediction model is a valuable tool for financial institutions to assess credit risk and make informed decisions about lending.
